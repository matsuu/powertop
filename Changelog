	  the cpu is 100% busy as reported by Friedrich
	* Cosmetic code cleanups (Lindent) as suggested by David Brownell
	* Get rid of popen() and the static sized events array 
	  (Keith Packard)
	* Add some more tips for kernel config options based on various
	  reports/feedback
	* Improve "you are not root so can't get timerstats" message to say 
	  that you need to be root rather than that you need to change your
	  kernel config
	* Make a better effort at locating the kernel .config file
	* Don't show "please turn CONFIG_FOO off" if the kernel you have
	  doesn't even support CONFIG_FOO (yet)
