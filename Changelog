1.6 --
	* Add suggestion to rf_kill unused wireless interfaces
	* Propose killing "sealert"; this is a new thing in F7 that wakes up
	  10 times per second for no reason
	* avoid showing the laptop mode hint when on AC - Val Henson
	* suggest enabling noatime to save disk IO's

1.5 -- May 27th, 2007
	* fix resize-corrupts-screen-content bug
	* add interrupts to the wakeups/second data in the emulated
	  (non-mobile) case
	* calculate a long term power usage from battery charge deltas;
	  this should help people whos battery doesn't report discharge
	  rates, and also will provide a less noisy datapoint
	* Add option to use `kill` on some known power hogs if they are
	  actually waking up a lot:
	  - beagle (even latest wakes up 10 times/second when not indexing)
	  - hal (suggest to stop cdrom polling)
	  - gnome-power-manager 
	  These only show if these actually wake up the cpu 'a lot'; so if
	  these get fixed then the suggestion will not display.

1.4 -- May 25th, 2007
	* use gettext to allow translation
          (with lots of thanks to the various translators, especially
	   to Benjamin Pineau who showed me how to use gettext tools)
	* fix bluethooth-checks-cause-autload-of-bluetooth bug
	* use ncurses (Sebastian Kuzminsky)
	* rotate through the suggestions randomly, so that all of them
	  will show over time
	* Fix the CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE check to only report on ac97 hw
	* report "hidden but suprious" timer ticks (due to missing hpet or
	  lack of NO_HZ)
	* check for HPET being present; if not suggest user to toggle in
   	  BIOS or apply the patch
	* Some suggestions have become "active", you can press a key to
	  tune it right away.
	* Add active suggestion to enable AC97 powersave mode at runtime
	* Add active suggestion to enable wireless powersave mode at runtime
	* Add active suggestion to enable ondemand


1.3 -- May 21st, 2007
	* Add suggestion for CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE
	* Fix inefficient code for readdir (Vince Pinter)
	* Highlight the worst offenders in bold (Vince Pinter)
	* Fix crash when running on 2.4 kernels (Harald Fernengel)
	* Check fgets() return values (Timom Hoenig @ SuSE)
	* add suggestion to enable laptop mode (when disabled)
	* add suggestion to disable bluetooth when unused

1.2 -- May 14th, 2007
	* Manpage contributed by Carlo Segre from the Debian project
	* Fix "shows power usage even on AC" bug, spotted by Steinar
 	  Gunderson
 	* Fix for batteries that report mA instead of mW from Friedrich
	  Oslage

1.1 -- May 13th, 2007
	* Fix bug that shows "you don't have C-states" on mobile CPUs when 
	  the cpu is 100% busy as reported by Friedrich
	* Cosmetic code cleanups (Lindent) as suggested by David Brownell
	* Get rid of popen() and the static sized events array 
	  (Keith Packard)
	* Add some more tips for kernel config options based on various
	  reports/feedback
	* Improve "you are not root so can't get timerstats" message to say 
	  that you need to be root rather than that you need to change your
	  kernel config
	* Make a better effort at locating the kernel .config file
	* Don't show "please turn CONFIG_FOO off" if the kernel you have
	  doesn't even support CONFIG_FOO (yet)
	* Show absolute per-second wakeup counts too (multiple requestors)
	* Add capability to suggest disabling daemons and the like
	

1.0 -- May 11th, 2007
	* Initial Release
